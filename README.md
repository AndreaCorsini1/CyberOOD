# CyberOOD
Official repository of the paper: 
"Are Existing Out-Of-Distribution Techniques Suitable for Network Intrusion Detection?"


There are two entrypoints in this project:

1. The train.py file that should be used to train models.
2. The test.py file that loads a trained model and uses the OOD detectors to find OOD data.
